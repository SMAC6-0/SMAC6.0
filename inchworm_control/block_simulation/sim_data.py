'''
The purpose of this file is to store all data necessary to run a simulation of 
*multiple* inchworms building a structure. It is NOT the running of the engine (textures, 
colors, button presses). This simulation simulates not the processes of any one robot, but of 
all inchworm agents. It assumes that the blocks are able to communicate with each other as 
desired. It must store all inchworms, the desired structure, and the current map as interpreted
by "the structure" a.k.a. the blocks themselves. This simulation assumes that inchworms 
"get updated" by interfacing with the existing structure. It also assumes that the seed block 
is located at its final position from the beginning.
